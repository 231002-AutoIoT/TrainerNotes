# Written Response Quizzes

Each week they are given a prompt/email to respond to in order to practice their written communication skills in a professional setting. This is to be used when QC Coding Challenges are not applicable.

## Week 2


Your supervisor, Christina Dumont, has asked you to write a follow up email for a recent team meeting. This was a technical planning meeting to discuss the new automotive Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) system your team will be developing and testing. Use the notes provided below to 

 

Based on the meeting notes below, please explain in detail your opinion or idea of the:

(1) best sensor to use by giving source material from a real device
(2) the best response to the sensors information given a legitimate source
(3) the requirements for your system back by real examples
(4) any DTC that might trigger during system failures. 
Please describe the function of the system in a professional manner. Remember that your response should be formatted as an email, including a greeting and signature.

 
```
TPMS Meeting Notes:

Possible Sensors:

Individual pressure sensors in each tire (monitors the air pressure in each wheel)
Level monitor for entire vehicle (detects if vehicle is not level)
ABS speed sensor monitoring (detects a low tire inflation by comparing all wheel speeds to one another since a flat tire would rotate faster to keep up with the others), 
Suspension monitor (detects a difference in the amount of travel in the suspension of each wheel, indicating a low tire pressure.
Possible responses to Sensor: 

Illuminate the MIL
Audible chime every 5 minutes
Illuminate a designated warning light
Display an alert on the infotainment screen
Disable the vehicle transmission until corrected.

## Week 3

You've received the following email from a new team member struggling with the CAN Bus system, please read CAREFULLY and respond according to the situation.

```
Subject: Request for Clarification on CAN Bus Systems and Networks

Good Afternoon,

It was a pleasure meeting you during our on boarding, Magesh recommend I reach out to you seek further clarity on our recent discussions surrounding CAN Bus systems and networks. As I engage with the material, I'm encountering challenges, particularly in understanding how CAN Bus addresses real-world issues.

One specific example that has me puzzled is related to a recent automotive project we discussed. Imagine a scenario where multiple electronic control units (ECUs) in a modern vehicle are interconnected through a CAN Bus. The challenge arises when there's a sudden spike in data traffic due to various simultaneous operations, such as engine diagnostics, anti-lock braking system (ABS) signals, and airbag deployment information.

In such a situation, I'm struggling to visualize how the CAN Bus effectively manages and prioritizes these data transmissions to prevent conflicts or delays in critical signals. A practical example or case study demonstrating how CAN Bus resolves or mitigates conflicts in a high-traffic scenario like this would greatly aid my understanding.

Additionally, I would appreciate any recommended source materials or documentation you could share with a brief description of its content. Having more references at my disposal will undoubtedly assist in deepening my comprehension of CAN Bus systems and networks.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I'm eager to overcome these challenges and contribute more effectively to our team.

Best regards,
Thomas Henry E. Newman

## Week 4
You've received the following email from your supervisor regarding an upcoming project, please read CAREFULLY and respond according to your current project status.

```
Subject: Project Update and Delivery Expectations for Thursday

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach our project deadline on Thursday, I'd like to request an update on the progress of our current work involving the modeling of several ECUs in Simulink and BusMaster through model-based design.

Please provide a comprehensive rundown of the tasks completed so far, any challenges encountered, and your plan for the remaining steps leading up to delivery. Additionally, ensure that all your documentation, including Simulink models and BusMaster configurations, is well-organized and accessible. Kindly specify the location where these documents are stored.

Your cooperation in this matter is crucial for a smooth review process and successful project completion. If you foresee any potential delays or issues that might impact the delivery timeline, please communicate them at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication to this project. Let's work together to ensure a successful and timely delivery.

Best regards,
Mercedes Cabriolet
