# Capstone Project
## Requirements

The project focuses on leveraging the initial stages of our Model-Based Design systems all the way through SIL testing. Select at least 5 ECUs, working together in an automotive system that you must approve through your trainer. You will present a rough draft of the topics 1-3 for approval and insurance you're on the right track with your project. Final presentations will occur Thursday afternoon, presenting in a professional format (i.e. PPT) and showcasing the simulation of this system as it was designed through Simulink. See each topic below for details of expectations for each section. 

All material must be submitted to SharePoint, see submission instructions below!

1. (C) Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
   - A document that describes a proposed system concept and how that concept would be operated in an intended environment.  The user community develops the CONOPS to communicate the vision for the operational system to the acquisition and developer community. A CONOPS can also be written by the buyer, developer, or acquirer to communicate their understanding of the userâ€™s needs and how a system will fulfill them.

2. (C) Requirements & Architecture (includes Block Diagram)
    - Document will typically describe the system's functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc. requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. 
    - High-level overview
    - Include source material of real-world examples

3. (C) Detailed Design Diagrams (includes Circuit Diagram)
    - Baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. 
    - Low-level overview.
    - Include Source Material of real-world examples

4. Module Design and Simulation (Simulink)
    - You model each component within the system structure to represent the physical or functional behavior of that component. You verify the basic component behavior by simulating them using test data.
    - Model the system in simulink based on all the prior material to begin simulating the system to test components are working as expected.

### Submission of Material
