# Capstone Project
## Requirements

The project focuses on leveraging the initial stages of our Model-Based Design systems all the way through SIL testing. Select at least 5 ECUs, working together in an automotive system that you must approve through your trainer. You will present a rough draft of the topics 1-3 for approval and insurance you're on the right track with your project. Final presentations will occur Thursday afternoon, presenting in a professional format (i.e. PPT) and showcasing the simulation of this system as it was designed through Simulink. See each topic below for details of expectations for each section. 

All material must be submitted to SharePoint, see submission instructions below!

1. (C) Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
   - A document that describes a proposed system concept and how that concept would be operated in an intended environment.  The user community develops the CONOPS to communicate the vision for the operational system to the acquisition and developer community. A CONOPS can also be written by the buyer, developer, or acquirer to communicate their understanding of the userâ€™s needs and how a system will fulfill them.

2. (C) Requirements & Architecture (includes Block Diagram)
    - Document will typically describe the system's functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc. requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. 
    - High-level overview
    - Include source material of real-world examples

3. (C) Detailed Design Diagrams (includes Circuit Diagram)
    - Baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. 
    - Low-level overview.
    - Include Source Material of real-world examples

4. Module Design and Simulation (Simulink)
    - You model each component within the system structure to represent the physical or functional behavior of that component. You verify the basic component behavior by simulating them using test data.
    - Model the system in simulink based on all the prior material to begin simulating the system to test components are working as expected.

### Submission of Material

Please upload all materials for this project into this [capstone-project](https://revaturetech.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/231002-OnlineVA-AutomotiveiOTTesting/Ek2mNSSpAfVNlyeJbNs3n60BtxqdXjS7M0ZdwGW0JEM7jw?e=jmQLdq) folder on the sharepoint, under your own personal folder as follows:
1. Name personal folder firstname-lastname
2. Within personal folder, include the following folders:
   - `conops` - contains material for Concept of Operations
   - `ddd` - contains material for Detailed Design Diagrams
   - `md&s` - contains material for Module Design & Simulation
   - `r&a` - contains material for Research & Architecture
3. Within your personal folder, please include a copy of the slide deck as presented on Thursday

# Capstone Presentation Guidelines

## Structure

***NOTE: NO READING FROM YOUR PPT! You can have bullets & images for helpful guides, but don't overwhelm any one given slide***

1. Introduction of yourself & system (30-40s)
   1. This will emphasize the material contained within in CONOPs
   2. Basic laymen's terms of how you system intends to imrprove the user experience.
   3. You can mention and include an image of your doc, but NOT the entire slide
2. Requirements & Architecture (30-60s)
   1. Showcase your Block Diagram within the slide (not the entire slide
3. Detailed Design Diagrams (30-60s)
   1. Showcase your Circuit Diagram within the slide (not the entire slide)
4. Module Design & Simulation (4-5 min)
   1. BusMaster & Simulink, have simulations loaded, ready to swap to and run the simulation.
   2. Demo your application, this should be the longest section
   3. Explain what your simulation is handling for each, but do NOT show off code! Image/screenshot of code is ok.
5. Issues & Challenges Faced(Optional - if time Permits)
   1. Short reflection on any challenges faced during this process
   2. Any issues with technologies and how you overcome
6. Question & Answer
   1. Expect to answer questions about your system/project.
   2. DO NOT need a slide for questions, but should expect it
