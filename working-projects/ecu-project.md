## Project 1 - ECU Mini project:

Length: 1 week

Present for End of Day on Friday.

### Overview

Research and design a simple automotive system, modeling the behavior and environment of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). System design includes a sensor suite, circuit block diagramming, ECU logic, and expected output values and possible Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). Specific sensor research and selection includes any relevent conversion factors, and circuit diagramming includes the use of appropriate power ground circuits and ECU blocking. ECU logic design includes pseudo-coding the conversion of signal values to meaningful values, determining nominal ranges and failure conditions, and describing the failure behaviors.

### Requirements

1. Pick a system within your vehicle
    - determine appropriate sensors for that system
    - determine appropriate end results/functions to control for that system
    - determine how an ECU might/does control those functions
2. Determine the metrics input to the ECU from the sensor
3. Determine how you would convert the information provided by the sensor into real information
    - Reference the source for your data & calculations
4. Construct a circuit diagram that considers a variety of factors
    - What conditions are being monitored by the sensors?
    - What signal does the sensor produce for those conditions?
    - What does the ECU do for each of those signals?
    - What happens as a result of the ECU within the car?
5. Present how it works
    - Include your circuit diagram
    - Describe your sensor(s) and their function
    - Describe the mathematical model (algorithm) for your sensor and it's signal
    - Present any research/resources used to develop your circuit
