# Cumulative QC

## Katherin

Associate: Samuel Tessema
Give me a topic you're confident, from last week, and I'll ask follow ups?
- CANoe/CANalyzers
What programming languages you use for CAPL?
- Not exactly sure, but I would say C is the underlying 
Any codings last week?
- not really
How do you handle errors?
- Preparing a certain condition that triggers whenever an error happens and those conditions will handle
Can you talk about CAPL?
How do you manipulate Messages?
What can you talk about Stateflows in Simulink?

Associate: Lawrence Straughter
List me the benefits of Simulink:
Any ideas of HIL?
Talk about Messaging?
Interaction and Integration with Simulink?

Feedback: 3 greens, 1 lime, 2 yellow (Samuel & Juan - lack of clarity)

## Zia

## Anabel
...
Different ways to create a model in Simulink?
3 subdivisions of a model in simulink, can you name and specifically explain it?
Which signal processing components are available in simulink? 
No no no, listen to my questions, I need the signal processing components?
Why would you want to run your simulation faster than real-time? - Rephrase - Why do you want to run faster than real-time? - Why we need to run faster?
...

## Daniel Xu

...
MATLAB commands?
What is Stateflow?
Real-time analysis & diagnostics? - Can you tell me specifically? 
Show me a simulation for stateflow? (share screen)

## Rodolfo
Tell me about yourself
What are workflows? - Rudy: Could you please specify the relation to the workflows? - What are workflows in CANalyzer? ; Rudy - eventually idk
What are environment variables in CANalyzer?
What is a use of functional algorithms in simulink?; idk
Examples where I can use stateflow?
What are the specific systems that could be modeled using stateflow? - Rudy: uhmmmm - Can you give me an example? 
Is it possible to have multiple initial states in Stateflow?
Can there be multiple initial states at any given time?
Active. Multiple initial states can be active?
Entry action with Stateflows?
Why do we need entry action?
Can you show me implementation of functional algorithm in simulink? - attempted but then idk

## Sajjan
Tell me about yourself
Simulation vs Testing?
What is message manipulation?
What is CAPL?
Where do we use it?
How do you simulate a system using Simulink?
What is real-time vs simulation?
Share your screen and show some event handlers in CAN?
