# Capstone Presentation Guidelines

## Structure

***NOTE: NO READING FROM YOUR PPT! You can have bullets & images for helpful guides, but don't overwhelm any one given slide***

1. Introduction of yourself & system (30-40s)
   1. This will emphasize the material contained within in CONOPs
   2. Basic laymen's terms of how you system intends to imrprove the user experience.
   3. You can mention and include an image of your doc, but NOT the entire slide
2. Requirements & Architecture (30-60s)
   1. Showcase your Block Diagram within the slide (not the entire slide
3. Detailed Design Diagrams (30-60s)
   1. Showcase your Circuit Diagram within the slide (not the entire slide)
4. Module Design & Simulation (4-5 min)
   1. BusMaster & Simulink, have simulations loaded, ready to swap to and run the simulation.
   2. Demo your application, this should be the longest section
   3. Explain what your simulation is handling for each, but do NOT show off code! Image/screenshot of code is ok.
5. Issues & Challenges Faced(Optional - if time Permits)
   1. Short reflection on any challenges faced during this process
   2. Any issues with technologies and how you overcome
6. Question & Answer
   1. Expect to answer questions about your system/project.
   2. DO NOT need a slide for questions, but should expect it
