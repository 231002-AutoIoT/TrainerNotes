# CL Mini-projects

## Mini Team Project
**Due: Nov 3rd**
Two Teams of 4, One Team of 5

### Overview

The goal of this project, is to repeat the Capstone, with reduced requirements, practicing the same experience but working together as a team on the system. This will be to keep material fresh and work on collaboration. Interviews are happening this week, which take priority, but try to split time accordingly. Presentations will happen Friday November 3rd, after lunch. 

***NOTE: Main objective is to show work completed throughout the week with these, it doesn't necessarily need to be 100% completed and polished***

### Requirements

Select at least 2 ECUs for each team member, working together in an automotive system(s) of your choosing. After completion of the material you and your team will present to trainers Friday afternoon post-lunch.

All material must be submitted to SharePoint, see submission instructions below!

1. (C) Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
   - A document that describes a proposed system concept and how that concept would be operated in an intended environment.  The user community develops the CONOPS to communicate the vision for the operational system to the acquisition and developer community. A CONOPS can also be written by the buyer, developer, or acquirer to communicate their understanding of the userâ€™s needs and how a system will fulfill them.

2. (C) Requirements & Architecture (includes Block Diagram)
    - Document will typically describe the system's functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc. requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. 
    - High-level overview
    - Include source material of real-world examples

3. (C) Detailed Design Diagrams (includes Circuit Diagram)
    - Baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. 
    - Low-level overview.
    - Include Source Material of real-world examples

4. Module Design and Simulation (Simulink)
    - You model each component within the system structure to represent the physical or functional behavior of that component. You verify the basic component behavior by simulating them using test data.
    - Model the system in simulink based on all the prior material to begin simulating the system to test components are working as expected.

### Submission

Presentation to trainers & submit all material worked on to your cohort sharepoint under the [`cl_mini_projects/mini-team`]() folder. Please create your own folder with a team name, including a document outlining your team members and their respective ECUs.

## DSpace Prep
**Due: Nov 15th**

### Overview

Preperatory exploration into the offerings of DSpace and the material they are about to embark on through DSpaces virtual training. Research and documentation to help further their understanding of the material as they begin to work on it and allows for a centralized location of information that's freely available on the Web.

### Requirements

Research as much as you can on the following topics, provide any material, pdfs, documentation as possible to this location. This will allow a one-stop shop for those of you going through the DSpace training.

Focused Topics:

- Scalexio HIL
- ControlDesk 
- AutomationDesk

### Submission

Submit all material worked on to your cohort sharepoint under the [`cl_mini_projects/dspace-prep`]() folder. All resources and material associated with DSpace should be placed within the directory provided. No need for additional folders.
