## Mini Team Project
**Due: Nov 3rd**

Two Teams of 4, One Team of 5

### Overview

The goal of this project, is to repeat the Capstone, with reduced requirements, practicing the same experience but working together as a team on the system. This will be to keep material fresh and work on collaboration. Interviews are happening this week, which take priority, but try to split time accordingly. Presentations will happen Friday November 3rd, after lunch. 

***NOTE: Main objective is to show work completed throughout the week with these, it doesn't necessarily need to be 100% completed and polished***

### Requirements

Select at least 2 ECUs for each team member, working together in an automotive system(s) of your choosing. After completion of the material you and your team will present to trainers Friday afternoon post-lunch.

All material must be submitted to SharePoint, see submission instructions below!

1. (C) Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
   - A document that describes a proposed system concept and how that concept would be operated in an intended environment.  The user community develops the CONOPS to communicate the vision for the operational system to the acquisition and developer community. A CONOPS can also be written by the buyer, developer, or acquirer to communicate their understanding of the userâ€™s needs and how a system will fulfill them.

2. (C) Requirements & Architecture (includes Block Diagram)
    - Document will typically describe the system's functional, interface, performance, data, security, etc. requirements as expected by the user. It is used by business analysts to communicate their understanding of the system to the users. 
    - High-level overview
    - Include source material of real-world examples

3. (C) Detailed Design Diagrams (includes Circuit Diagram)
    - Baseline in selecting the architecture is that it should realize all which typically consists of the list of modules, brief functionality of each module, their interface relationships, dependencies, database tables, architecture diagrams, technology details etc. 
    - Low-level overview.
    - Include Source Material of real-world examples

4. Module Design and Simulation (Simulink)
    - You model each component within the system structure to represent the physical or functional behavior of that component. You verify the basic component behavior by simulating them using test data.
    - Model the system in simulink based on all the prior material to begin simulating the system to test components are working as expected.

### Submission

Presentation to trainers & submit all material worked on to your cohort sharepoint under the [`cl-mini-projects/mini-team`](https://revaturetech.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/231002-OnlineVA-AutomotiveiOTTesting/Em0xuyL4LIJPn_y9U7SkC_kBCNdPzkn_vsp3fyhAj2P9Hg?e=JTGnnL) folder. Please create your own folder with a team name, including a document outlining your team members and their respective ECUs.

## Mini BusMaster & CANoe
**Due: Nov 10th**

### Overview

For the training of new automotive engineers in CAN communication systems, tasks can be assigned using either CANoe or BusMaster. While CANoe provides a user-friendly environment with certain limitations in its demo version, BusMaster, being open-source, offers flexibility with a potentially different user interface. Work through as many of the following with your choice of CANoe and BusMaster:

***Note: Be mindful of limitations such as the number of nodes and messages in CANoe's demo version and potential differences in the user interface and available features in BusMaster.***

### Requirements  

1. Basic CAN Communication Setup:
**Objective**: Simulate a simple CAN communication system between two nodes.
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Define two nodes in the car system.
        - Establish a basic CAN network between nodes.
        - Simulate message transmission.
        - Implement error handling mechanisms (e.g., error frames, acknowledgments).
        - Document the entire setup and provide a brief report on the implemented features.

2. Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Handling:
**Objective**: Develop a system to handle Diagnostic Trouble Codes using CANoe and BusMaster.
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Simulate various fault scenarios within the car system.
        - Define DTCs associated with these faults.
        - Implement a diagnostic communication mechanism using CAN.
        - Develop a strategy for identifying, storing, and clearing DTCs.
        - Provide a report detailing the implemented DTC handling process.

3. Data Logging and Analysis:
**Objective**: Set up a data logging and analysis system using CANoe and BusMaster.
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Identify critical parameters within the car system for logging.
        - Implement continuous data logging for these parameters.
        - Develop a mechanism to export and analyze logged data.
        - Create visualizations or reports for data analysis.
        - Document the setup and analysis process.

4. Network Management and Redundancy:
**Objective**: Implement network management features and redundancy using CANoe and BusMaster.
**Subtasks**:
    - Define multiple nodes in the car system with redundant paths.
    - Implement network management features like node status monitoring.
    - Introduce a failover mechanism for redundancy testing.
    - Document the setup, redundancy strategy, and test results.
    - Provide a brief report on the importance of network management in automotive systems.

### Submission
Presentation to trainers & submit all material worked on to your cohort sharepoint under the [`cl-mini-projects/mini-busmaster-canoe`](https://revaturetech.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/231002-OnlineVA-AutomotiveiOTTesting/EgGvHCOfikFGocSF8w_q234BUkwh49jSQfK5XNAqi1Aq3A?e=Gs8wTZ) folder.

## DSpace Prep
**Due: Nov 15th**

### Overview

Preperatory exploration into the offerings of DSpace and the material they are about to embark on through DSpaces virtual training. Research and documentation to help further their understanding of the material as they begin to work on it and allows for a centralized location of information that's freely available on the Web.

### Requirements

Research as much as you can on the following topics, provide any material, pdfs, documentation as possible to this location. This will allow a one-stop shop for those of you going through the DSpace training.

Focused Topics:

- Scalexio HIL
- ControlDesk 
- AutomationDesk

### Submission

Submit all material worked on to your cohort sharepoint under the [`cl-mini-projects/dspace-prep`](https://revaturetech.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/231002-OnlineVA-AutomotiveiOTTesting/EoQ8qa8DkBNCrd5eZ90Gx_gBIK64Qs1kTH3nkUAq056GPw?e=FfZbyz) folder. All resources and material associated with DSpace should be placed within the directory provided. No need for additional folders.
