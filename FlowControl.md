# Guidelines
## Start Simple:
Begin with high-level processes or states and then drill down into specifics.
## Use Standard Symbols:
Utilize ovals for start/end, rectangles for processes or actions, diamonds for decisions, and arrows to show flow.
## Keep It Clear:
Avoid over-complicating. If a section gets too complex, consider breaking it out into a sub-flowchart.
## Label Everything:
Every process, decision, and arrow should be clearly labeled to ensure understanding.
## Review and Refine:
After drafting, review the flowchart for any missing steps or logic errors. Iterate and refine as needed.

## Basic Traffic Light System:
Task: Model a basic traffic light system that transitions between green, yellow, and red states.
Extension: Add pedestrian lights and a button that triggers a pedestrian crossing phase.

## Elevator Control System:
Task: Design a state machine for an elevator system in a 3-floor building. Consider states like "Moving Up", "Moving Down", "Idle", etc.
Extension: Handle emergency situations, like when an emergency button is pressed.

## Temperature Control System:
Task: Model a thermostat control system. The system should have states like "Heating", "Cooling", "Idle", based on the current and desired temperatures.
Extension: Incorporate a fan system that turns on when the temperature is too high, even if the cooling isn't active.

## Digital Watch System:
Task: Design a state machine for a digital watch with modes like "Display Time", "Set Hours", "Set Minutes", and "Alarm".
Extension: Add stopwatch and timer functionalities.

## Password System:
Task: Model a system where a user enters a numeric password. The system should have states like "Awaiting Input", "Checking Password", "Access Granted", and "Access Denied".
Extension: Add a "Lockout" state if the incorrect password is entered three times in a row.

## Vending Machine:
Task: Design a state machine for a vending machine. Consider states for waiting for money, selecting products, dispensing, and giving change.
Extension: Incorporate a "Maintenance Mode" state.

## Music Player Interface:
Task: Model a basic music player with states like "Playing", "Paused", "Stopped", "Forward", and "Rewind".
Extension: Add volume control and track selection states.

## Automatic Door System:
Task: Design a state machine for an automatic sliding door. The door should open when someone approaches and close after they leave.
Extension: Add safety features, like a state for detecting if something is blocking the door.

## Battery Charging System:
Task: Model a battery charging system. Consider states like "Charging", "Full", "Discharging", and "Low Battery".
Extension: Integrate temperature monitoring and go into a "Cool Down" state if the battery gets too hot.

## Game Design:
Task: Design a simple game, like tic-tac-toe or a maze solver, using state logic to determine game states and player moves.
Extension: Incorporate more complex game mechanics or multi-player modes.
