# Mini Team Project
**Due: Nov 3rd**

Two Teams of 4, One Team of 5

## Overview

The goal of this project, is to repeat the Capstone, with reduced requirements, practicing the same experience but working together as a team on the system. This will be to keep material fresh and work on collaboration. Interviews are happening this week, which take priority, but try to split time accordingly. Presentations will happen Friday November 3rd, after lunch. 

***NOTE: Main objective is to show work completed throughout the week with these, it doesn't necessarily need to be 100% completed and polished. Priority for Projects will always be LOWEST. Anything client requests and demands during the onboarding and relocation process is HIGHEST priority***

## Requirements

Select at least 2 ECUs for each team member, working together in an automotive system(s). You may use the previous project work to save time. The purpose is to try and build an even larger system. After completion of the material you and your team will present to trainers Friday afternoon post-lunch.

All material must be submitted to SharePoint, see submission instructions below!

1. Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
   - Use previous projects CONOPS, if attempting something new for this project can be skipped

2. Requirements & Architecture (includes Block Diagram)
    - Generate a Block Diagram of all ECU systems & sensors that require interaction with one another and their logical components.
    - Include a Resource document providing the material for real-world examples of ECUs and Sensors.

3. Detailed Design Diagrams (includes Circuit Diagram)
    - Generate a Block Diagram of all ECU systems, along with their associated sensors.

4. Module Design and Simulation (Simulink)
    - Model the system in simulink based on all the prior material to begin simulating the system to test components are working as expected.

## Submission

Presentation to trainers & submit all material worked on to your cohort sharepoint under the [`cl-mini-projects/mini-team`](https://revaturetech.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/231002-OnlineVA-AutomotiveiOTTesting/Em0xuyL4LIJPn_y9U7SkC_kBCNdPzkn_vsp3fyhAj2P9Hg?e=JTGnnL) folder. Please generate a subfolder with a team name, including a document outlining your team members and their respective ECUs.
