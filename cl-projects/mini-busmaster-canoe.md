## Mini BusMaster & CANoe

**Due: Nov 10th**

### Overview

For the training of new automotive engineers in CAN communication systems, tasks must be completed with CANoe and BusMaster. While CANoe provides a user-friendly environment with certain limitations in its demo version, BusMaster, being open-source, offers flexibility with a potentially different user interface. Work through as many of the following with your choice of CANoe and BusMaster:

**_Note: Be mindful of limitations such as the number of nodes and messages in CANoe's demo version and potential differences in the user interface and available features in BusMaster._**

**_NOTE: Main objective is to show work completed throughout the week with these, it doesn't necessarily need to be 100% completed and polished. Priority for Projects will always be LOWEST. Anything client requests and demands during the onboarding and relocation process is HIGHEST priority_**

### Requirements

1. Basic CAN Communication Setup:

    - **Objective**: Simulate a simple CAN communication system between two nodes.
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Define two nodes in the car system.
        - Establish a basic CAN network between nodes.
        - Simulate message transmission.
        - Implement error handling mechanisms (e.g., error frames, acknowledgments).
        - Document the entire setup and provide a brief report on the implemented features.

1. Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Handling:

    - **Objective**: Develop a system to handle Diagnostic Trouble Codes using CANoe and BusMaster.
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Simulate various fault scenarios within the car system.
        - Define DTCs associated with these faults.
        - Implement a diagnostic communication mechanism using CAN.
        - Develop a strategy for identifying, storing, and clearing DTCs.
        - Provide a report detailing the implemented DTC handling process.

1. Data Logging and Analysis:

    - **Objective**: Set up a data logging and analysis system using CANoe and BusMaster.
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Identify critical parameters within the car system for logging.
        - Implement continuous data logging for these parameters.
        - Develop a mechanism to export and analyze logged data.
        - Create visualizations or reports for data analysis.
        - Document the setup and analysis process.

1. Network Management and Redundancy:
    - **Objective**: Implement network management features and redundancy using CANoe and BusMaster.
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Define multiple nodes in the car system with redundant paths.
        - Implement network management features like node status monitoring.
        - Introduce a failover mechanism for redundancy testing.
        - Document the setup, redundancy strategy, and test results.
        - Provide a brief report on the importance of network management in automotive systems.
